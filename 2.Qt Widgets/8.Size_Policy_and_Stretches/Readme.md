Hi everyone🎇

In this example I adjusted size policy of widgets in the layouts in widget.ui folder . After that, I did a simple application with Dial and Slider in order to be fun😄

Let's look at this example🍀

When you input some value in the SpinBox Widget then Slider value is adjusted accordingly SpinBox value. I connected value of Slider and Dial. When value of Slider cahnges then value of Dial changes🤓

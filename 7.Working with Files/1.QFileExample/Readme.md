Hi everyone🙋‍♀️

In this project, I showed you how to wirte or read a File in Qt with a simple example😊

When you Click the *Write* Button, a File Folder opens and asks for the name of the file to save and write text on the TextEdit into the File✅

When you Click the *Read* Button, a File Folder opens and asks for the name of the file to read and write text in the file on the QTextEdit🧧

When you Click the *Copy* Button, a File Folder opens and asks for the name of the copied file to save and write text on the source file into destination file⚒️

When you Click the *Start* Button, datas in the seleceted file are started to be sent. In this project, In the source file has 2 datas in the 1 line. First one is time,
Second one is data. Datas are sent differences between time value from 2 lines🔗

Hi everyone🙋‍♀️

In this example, I changed language of application by clicking 2 different Buttons✅

When I click the "Ingilizce" Buton, applications language becomes in English. When I click the Turkish Button, applications language becomes Turkce💻

Note: In this example, we saw that LineEdits placeHoldertext doesn't change if we changed the language👌

Hi everyoneðŸ˜Š

In this project, I did a simple project that can guess a random number by entering numbers from users.

If users enter a value that is not a number, an error window is open.

When users enter a value, it indicates the relationship between the numbers, making it easier for them to make accurate predictions.
